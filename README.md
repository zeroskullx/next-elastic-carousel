# Next Elastic Carousel

Next Elastic Carousel is a fork of the original [`react-elastic-carousel`](https://sag1v.github.io/react-elastic-carousel/). This repository was created to address versioning issues and bugs found in the original package. Our goal is to provide a more stable and reliable carousel component for React applications.

## Features

- **Improved versioning**: Ensuring consistent and predictable updates.
- **Bug fixes**: Addressing known issues from the original repository.
- **New name**: As the name has been changed to Next Elastic Carousel, it is not compatible with the original React Elastic Carousel.

Feel free to contribute by opening issues or submitting pull requests!
